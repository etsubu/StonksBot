## Installation

### Prerequisites
You need to have Java 17 JDK installed on your system to run and compile the application.

### Building

```
git clone git@github.com:etsubu/StonksBot.git
cd StonksBot
./gradlew clean build
./gradlew shadowJar
```

The application .jar file will be located in build/libs/ with -all.jar suffix

For example build/libs/StonksBot-1.0-SNAPSHOT-all.jar

## Configuration

StonksBot requires you to provide discord oauth key in the configuration file. 
Place config.yaml file in the same directory with the .jar file and place the oauth key in there. 
About the available configs:
* globalAdmins:
  * This list of user ids defines admin users across all servers, the bot does not check server specific
     permissions for these users and allows them to send DM messages and commands as well
* servers:
  * This list contains separate configurations for different servers where the bot has joined
  * whitelistedChannels:
    * This list defines what channels users can use for running commands with the bot
  * reactions:
    * This list contains regex patterns which are compared to all messages sent in the server and if matched the bot will
    add a reaction to that message
  * adminGroup:
    * This list defines server specific admins which can bypass the whitelistedChannels restriction
  * trustedGroup:
    * Less permissive version of the adminGroup allows to bypass whitelistedChannels restriction

Note that instead of names, the configs require you to use ID values. The benefit is that if channel/user/server names change 
this does not affect the unique id values. In order to be able to copy ID values you need to enable developer mode in discord.
Instructions on how to do this are provided at https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-
    
Example: 

```

```

## Contributing

Some of the bots features are kind a niche such as lunch list which is due to usage and thus requirements of a 
private server. However, new commands can be easily added by creating new files in com.stonksbot.core/Commands/ folder and 
implementing Command interface. The bot finds available commands during runtime meaning there is no need to register 
the commands in a separate place. 

Make sure the code compiles, tests pass, and verification plugins pass, before opening a Pull Request.

## Search

The commands are able to fetch stock data by either their name, ticker or ISIN code, the search functionality uses 
yahoo finance's search API with exception being !recommendation command which uses inderes API.
Using ticker or ISIN is the most precise way to define what stock should be queried but using prefix of the name 
is also supported but the results might be unexpected.
